## Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed:

- [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

## Instructions

1. **Download the script and edit it to your liking**

    You are able to change the delay and keybind to toggle the script. This only works if you're holding down the said button, for comfort reasons. (i.e the buttons on the side of your mouse, any key, etc.)

2. **Load up the game**

   Once you've set everything up, load up Black Ops, and get into a really sticky situation.

3. **Profit**

    Your walk speed is nearly at running speed. Have fun.

4. **Demonstration**

  This macro alone has saved my ass on countless occasions. Originally started off as a "Russian Walk" from Counter-Strike 1.6 for Fortnite Ballistic, later being utilized in other games.
  A tiny (and I mean, tiny) compilation of this working. All of these were clipped in the span of about ~30 minutes during a game of Zombies.

## To Do
- [ ] Set a variable for the keybind. (I highly doubt this will ever be done, as I'm just way too lazy)
